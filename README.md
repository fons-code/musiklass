# Musiklass landing page

The design was made for the [perfect landing](https://platzi.com/blog/olimpiadas-the-perfect-landing/), a challenge within the platzi platform using Figma. Being one of the pages chosen for the [award](https://platzi.com/blog/premiacion-the-perfect-landing/) I made the decision to layout it using HTML and CSS to practice my frontend skills.
